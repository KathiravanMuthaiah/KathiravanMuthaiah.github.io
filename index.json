It wasn‚Äôt a literal translation‚Äîit was more like a heartfelt interpretation. After a few rounds of revisions, I had a version that I felt captured the mood I experience whenever I listen to the song. This process itself was enjoyable. It was a dialogue between my heart, the song‚Äôs essence, and a tool that could reflect and refine my thoughts. It is always fun to talk to a reflection of you with more abilities to express easily what you felt. Here is the output **\"Dream oh my dream\"** A silent death stole a soul away, A lofty dream fell to the earth today. Pride departed, directions blurred, In the flames of solitude, I burned. Shadows faded, truths dissolved, Within myself, I searched, unresolved. Oh dream, oh dream, why do you fade? Why do these hands bear scars that won‚Äôt abate? Oh memory, oh memory, why do you wane? Why does my world shatter in pain? Eyes adrift in streams of tears, Living like a fish in waters unclear. Does God exist, does love endure? Or is it all a lie, a fate unsure? Here I am, engulfed in pain, There you are, smiling again. I searched the winds for words once spoken, Only to find promises broken. Is this just? Can my heart sustain? Are my dreams a sin, a source of blame? Once you get the output as a developer you always wanted to share and see the output. A moment of visualising the output always a sense of satisfaction. I also wanted to visualise the output in an art form. Started imagining how the scene would be I turned them into prompts to generate images using ChatGPT and the Flux model for image generation. Watching the tool produce visual interpretations of the emotion I felt was a moment of pure euphoria. Prompt used to generate image in both the AI tools: A somber, emotional scene set in a quiet, desolate landscape at dusk. A lone figure, dressed in dark, tattered clothing, sits on the ground, head bowed, surrounded by broken, feathered wings scattered like remnants of shattered dreams. The background is vast and barren, with a faint, blurred horizon symbolizing lost direction. Fading silhouettes of memories, like translucent shadows, drift into the air. Nearby, a small pool of water reflects the figure's tear-streaked face, with their eyes resembling a fish swimming in sorrow.
