Our goal is not to “run PostgreSQL in Docker.” Our goal is to engineer a reusable infrastructure component you can plug into any project. 🎯 What We Are Building in Part 1 This module provides a standalone PostgreSQL instance inside the repository under: infra-docker-series/modules/postgres/ Once built, this module: Runs independently using make up Provides health checks using pg_isready Stores data consistently under docker-volume/data/ Uses pinned Docker image versions (no latest) Exposes a simple smoke test (SELECT 1) Can be reused across any other project you build If you learn the pattern here, every future module will feel natural. 1. 🧱 Folder Structure — Postgres Module Inside the mono-repo, the PostgreSQL module lives here: modules/ postgres/ docs/ README.md requirements.md design-intent.md diagrams/ infra/ docker-compose.yml docker-volume/ data/ scripts/ test_health.sh .env.example Makefile Jenkinsfile This layout is the canonical scaffold for the entire series. Kafka, Mosquitto, Keycloak, Prometheus, and all future parts will follow this identical pattern. 🧩 The Architecture (Simple but as-is) Data is bind-mounted locally (not named volumes) A dedicated Docker network postgres_net isolates traffic Everything is driven by environment variables loaded from .env This keeps it production-minded while still very easy to work with.

You can rotate credentials without committing secrets. You can upgrade PostgreSQL by adjusting a single version variable. This reflects real-world configuration hygiene. 4. 🐘 docker-compose.yml — Pinned, Predictable, Safe The module’s docker-compose.yml pins PostgreSQL to a specific version: image: postgres:${POSTGRES_VERSION} and sets a solid health check: healthcheck: test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready -U $$POSTGRES_USER -d $$POSTGRES_DB\"] interval: 10s timeout: 5s retries: 5 start_period: 15s The container is only considered ready when PostgreSQL is truly accepting connections. This tiny decision prevents unpredictable behavior in downstream systems—something every engineer learns the hard way at least once. 5. 🔧 Makefile-Driven Lifecycle Every module in this series uses the same Makefile contract: Command What It Does make init Creates .env, prepares folders, pulls images make up Starts the PostgreSQL container make test Health check + smoke test (SELECT 1) make down Stops the service make clean Stops service + removes data (with confirmation) make psql Opens an interactive shell inside PostgreSQL You can run it inside the module: cd modules/postgres make init make up make test make psql make down Or from the root of the repo: make init MODULE=postgres make up MODULE=postgres make test MODULE=postgres This uniform experience across all modules is the core training aspect of this series. 6. 🩺 Smoke Test: Trust, but Verify After make up, you run: make test This executes test_health.sh which: Checks Docker health status → must be healthy Runs: SELECT 1; via psql inside the container. If both succeed, your PostgreSQL module is considered operational. If either fails, logs are suggested: make logs This one minute test ensures your infra module isn’t just “running”… …it’s actually working. 7. 💾 Persistence Strategy Your data lives here: modules/postgres/docker-volume/data/ This folder: is bind-mounted (not named volume) is owned by this module only is always safe to delete manually if needed is ignored from Git by default This approach: Lets you snapshot/copy/backup easily Ensures no global Docker volumes pollute your system Keeps module state self-contained Exactly how enterprise infra-as-code teams work. 8. 🧪 Real-World Deployment Notes (Quick) Even though this module runs locally: The same Docker Compose file becomes your base for Kubernetes StatefulSets. .env values map to Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps. docker-volume/data maps to PersistentVolumeClaims. Healthchecks translate to liveness/readiness probes. This is deliberate. This series trains you for real production patterns, not just local demos. 9. ⚠️ Common Pitfalls (and How We Avoid Them) Pitfall How This Module Prevents It Using latest image Version pinned in .env.example Global Docker volumes Local bind-mount inside module only Weak health checks pg_isready validates actual DB readiness Secrets committed to git .env ignored, .env.example only Data loss on tear-down make clean requires explicit confirmation Non-repeatable setup Dete","date":"2025-12-07","objectID":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part1/:2:8","tags":["docker","postgresql","infrastructure-module","devops","reusable-infrastructure","database-engineering"],"title":"Building Infrastructure with Docker — Part 1: PostgreSQL","uri":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part1/"},{"categories":["Engineering","Infrastructure","Docker Series"],"content":"GitHub Repository Link 🔗 Project Repo: https://github.com/KathiravanMuthaiah/infrastructureWithDocker ","date":"2025-12-07","objectID":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part1/:2:9","tags":["docker","postgresql","infrastructure-module","devops","reusable-infrastructure","database-engineering"],"title":"Building Infrastructure with Docker — Part 1: PostgreSQL","uri":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part1/"},{"categories":["Engineering","Infrastructure","Docker Series"],"content":"Building Infrastructure with Docker Series: post links 🔗 Building Infrastructure with Docker — Part0: 🔗 Building Infrastructure with Docker — Part2: “Technically authored by me, accelerated with insights from ChatGPT by OpenAI.” Refer: Leverage ChatGPT Happy Learning ","date":"2025-12-07","objectID":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part1/:2:10","tags":["docker","postgresql","infrastructure-module","devops","reusable-infrastructure","database-engineering"],"title":"Building Infrastructure with Docker — Part 1: PostgreSQL","uri":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part1/"},{"categories":["Engineering","Docker","Infrastructure"],"content":"Kickstarting a hands-on series on building reusable, production-grade infrastructure modules with Docker — starting from PostgreSQL to Kafka, Prometheus, and beyond.","date":"2025-12-07","objectID":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part0/","tags":["docker","infrastructure","devops","kafka","postgresql","prometheus","grafana","keycloak","debezium"],"title":"Building Infrastructure with Docker — part 0","uri":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part0/"},{"categories":["Engineering","Docker","Infrastructure"],"content":"🧱 Building Infrastructure with Docker — Part 0 ","date":"2025-12-07","objectID":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part0/:0:0","tags":["docker","infrastructure","devops","kafka","postgresql","prometheus","grafana","keycloak","debezium"],"title":"Building Infrastructure with Docker — part 0","uri":"/posts/building_infrastructure_with_docker_part0/"},{"categories":["Engineering","Docker","Infrastructure"],"content":"The Journey to Reusable, Independent Infrastructure Modules When you start a new project, how many times do you rebuild the same supporting infrastructure — a database, a message broker, a cache, a monitoring stack — before writing your first line of application logic?

A man was walking slowly, his steps relaxed yet heavy, his shoulders gently slouched from a long, tiring day. The signs of exhaustion were clear — the weight of work still hanging on him even as he drifted away from it. But there was something deeper in the picture. Despite the fatigue, there was a quiet happiness on his face. A large ladies’ handbag rested on one shoulder, and on the other side, his wife held his hand with confident warmth. His steps wandered, almost aimless, but never lost — as if her presence anchored him. The comfort of that steady partner beside him gave him the energy he had spent all day earning. In that simple walk, the moment spoke aloud: the long day was worth it, the effort meaningful, because this — this companionship, this calm escape, this shared journey — is the reward. — Kathiravan Muthaiah Technically authored by me, with insights assisted by ChatGPT.

From the year 2020 until today (mid-2025), it has been nothing short of a thrill ride. I stepped away from what many considered the “safe job” in MNC life, moved to a small town with a different thought process, then lived through the rush of a high-paced startup, shifted into a tech-nomad (consultant) life and finally returned to an MNC in 2025. This has been more than a career shift; it has been a journey of constant learning — not only about technology but about myself, my relationships, and my values. Ironically, I learned more technology in these five years than I did in the previous eighteen years, but what stayed with me more deeply were the lessons about time, health, and the irreplaceable dimension of relationships.

And for some time, that seemed true — the sweet spots appeared, career growth happened, and the journey felt rewarding. But as the years passed, I realized that life is not always about timing or balance. It tests us against our principles and values more often than we expect. I began to see the shades of grey — moments when values fade, or when principles are risked even for a short while. The guilt and anger of those compromises linger longer than the events themselves. Over time, I came to understand: there is no such thing as “timing it right” or always finding the perfect balance. What truly matters is how we see, observe, and listen, and how well we have equipped ourselves early in life to face the shades of grey. My humble submission is this: if we can be satisfied that we gave our full effort, reason out with ourselves that the outcome is natural, and not dwell in perceptions of “fair” or “unfair,” then we are already successful in our path. Through all of this, one constant has stood out to me: the immense joy of being surrounded by people you truly want to be with. Beyond career, beyond achievements, the most enduring realization is simple — to be valued in someone’s life and to value them in return is the best definition of a successful life.

I have always liked the concept of angels. They are not born with wings — but in certain moments, we realize they exist. I am glad and grateful that I have been surrounded by such angels throughout this journey. One of them I met for only a few hours a day, over just three days, in a very limited professional space. Yet those moments helped me understand myself more deeply and left a lasting impression. That person became a mentor, and through him, I was introduced to another mentor both continues to amaze me — showing me that regardless of age, money, profession, or social standing, wisdom and guidance can shine through. These mentors have been a guiding light in ways I cannot put into words. Then, there are family and friends — the ones we too often take for granted. They are always there to rely on, yell at, fight with, frown at, and even ignore at times. But beneath all that, they remain the unshakable pillars of daily life. This doesn’t mean I have been “cleansed” or transformed into a perfectly behaved person. I remain human, with my same quirks and traits. The difference is that I now try harder to reciprocate the unconditional guardrails they provide — the support that keeps my journey safe today, tomorrow, and for however long it continues.

It is art that evokes the deepest emotions — songs, stories, movie scenes, or simple anecdotes that stir something inside us. Science may still be working to explain how these experiences shape our biology, but I have felt it many times: art heals, art triggers, art sustains. In moments when I was less active or unable to do much, I found myself listening more, reading more, and letting these pieces of art fill the silence. They always brought back memories — treasured times when I could act, feel, and share with others. Those moments were never about the activity alone; they were about the presence of another life form in that space. When I reflect deeply, I see why those memories are so special. They combine the time we had, the health that allowed us to act, and most importantly, the relationships that made the moment meaningful. Science may one day achieve time travel, allowing us to revisit moments in time. But even then, reality will remind us: the relationships that made those moments alive cannot be retrieved once lost. Without them, time is hollow, and health is just survival. So let us not only count the years but qualify them with the richness of relationships. Let us cherish each and every moment with loved ones, so that when we look back, we can say we created a life that mattered — not just a long life, but a meaningful one. To enjoy the time, music is one of the best way that too if reading alone. Sharing one such art helped me during the reflection: Watch on YouTube Same feeling but another reflection Watch on YouTube If you watch the link, you will see both have same intentions and share similar views. But journey and reflections created on each mind is much varied to equate mathematically. Similarly each of our path, journey and relationships are unique and let us cherish those.

This post is purely a personal reflection as a fan, exploring how technology enables new forms of creative enjoyment. All rights and ownership of the original work remain with the rightful creators. ‘Still any concerns or worries about the content, thought or anything, please reach out through DM LinkedIn’ Okie now let us enjoy the moment. There are certain songs that stay with you—not just as music, but as emotions you can revisit anytime. Recently, I spent some quiet time with one of my favourite Tamil songs: Watch on YouTube. This song has always fascinated me with its beautiful lyrics and mesmerising music. As a fan of art and technology, I wanted to explore how far today’s tools can help me experience a song in new dimensions—without ever taking away from the originality or essence of the work. Original Lyrics \"**கனவே கனவே**\" மௌனமான மரணம் ஒன்று உயிரை கொண்டு போனதே உயரமான கனவு இன்று தரையில் வீழ்ந்து போனதே திசையும் போனது திமிரும் போனது தனிமை தீயிலே வாடினேன் நிழலும் போனது நிஜமும் போனது எனக்குள் எனையே தேடினேன் கனவே கனவே கலைவதேனோ கரங்கள் ரணமாய் கரைவதேனோ நினைவே நினைவே அரைவதேனோ எனது உலகம் உடைவதேனோ கண்கள் ரெண்டும் நீரிலே மீனை போல வாழுதே கடவுளும் பெண் இதயமும் இருக்குதா அட இல்லையா ஓஹோ நானும் இங்கே வலியிலே நீயும் அங்கோ சிரிப்பிலே காற்றில் எங்கும் தேடினேன் பேசி போன வார்த்தையை இது நியாயமா மனம் தாங்குமா என் ஆசைகள் அது பாவமா... கனவே கனவே... கரங்கள் ரணமாய்... நினைவே நினைவே அரைவதேனோ எனது உலகம் உடைவதேனோ To test the artistic ability of AI I began by taking the original Tamil lyrics and, with the help of ChatGPT, created an English version that retained the emotional essence of the song. It wasn’t a literal translation—it was more like a heartfelt interpretation. After a few rounds of revisions, I had a version that I felt captured the mood I experience whenever I listen to the song. This process itself was enjoyable. It was a dialogue between my heart, the song’s essence, and a tool that could reflect and refine my thoughts. It is always fun to talk to a reflection of you with more abilities to express easily what you felt. Here is the output **\"Dream oh my dream\"** A silent death stole a soul away, A lofty dream fell to the earth today. Pride departed, directions blurred, In the flames of solitude, I burned. Shadows faded, truths dissolved, Within myself, I searched, unresolved. Oh dream, oh dream, why do you fade? Why do these hands bear scars that won’t abate? Oh memory, oh memory, why do you wane? Why does my world shatter in pain? Eyes adrift in streams of tears, Living like a fish in waters unclear. Does God exist, does love endure? Or is it all a lie, a fate unsure? Here I am, engulfed in pain, There you are, smiling again. I searched the winds for words once spoken, Only to find promises broken. Is this just? Can my heart sustain? Are my dreams a sin, a source of blame? Once you get the output as a developer you always wanted to share and see the output. A moment of visualising the output always a sense of satisfaction. I also wanted to visualise the output in an art form. Started imagining how the scene would be I turned them into prompts to generate images using ChatGPT and the Flux model for image generation. Watching the tool produce visual interpretations of the emotion I felt was a moment of pure euphoria. Prompt used to generate image in both the AI tools: A somber, emotional scene set in a quiet, desolate landscape at dusk. A lone figure, dressed in dark, tattered clothing, sits on the ground, head bowed, surrounded by broken, feathered wings scattered like remnants of shattered dreams. The background is vast and barren, with a faint, blurred horizon symbolizing lost direction. Fading silhouettes of memories, like translucent shadows, drift into the air. Nearby, a small pool of water reflects the figure's tear-streaked face, with their eyes resembling a fish swimming in sorrow.
